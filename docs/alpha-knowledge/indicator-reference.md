Indicator Reference üìä

This knowledge file defines key technical indicators and metrics often used in analysis, including how they are calculated, what they signify, and how traders commonly use them.

Average True Range (ATR)

What it is: ATR stands for Average True Range. It is a volatility indicator that measures the average range of price movement over a given period (typically 14 days)
investopedia.com
. The ‚Äútrue range‚Äù for each day is the greatest of: the distance from today‚Äôs high to low, or high to previous close, or low to previous close (this accounts for gaps). The ATR is then the moving average of that true range over the set period.

Interpretation:

A higher ATR value means higher volatility ‚Äì the asset‚Äôs price has larger swings/trading ranges in each period. A lower ATR means relatively low volatility (price is moving little day-to-day). ATR is absolute, in the asset‚Äôs price terms (e.g. ATR of 2 means ~$2 average move). Thus, compare ATR to the stock‚Äôs price: a $2 ATR on a $50 stock is significant; on a $500 stock, less so.

ATR does not indicate direction of price, only magnitude of movement
investopedia.com
. Rising ATR can accompany either sharp up or down moves (just more range). Often, ATR increases during market sell-offs due to panic volatility. It can also spike on breakouts or any strong trend day. Decreasing ATR suggests a market calming down or consolidating.

Uses:

Stop-Loss Setting: Traders often use ATR to set stop distances. For example, a rule might be ‚Äúplace stop 1.5√ó ATR below entry‚Äù for a long trade, to account for normal volatility noise. The chandelier exit is a famous technique: a trailing stop set some multiple of ATR (like 3√ó ATR) from the highest price achieved since entry
investopedia.com
. This adapts to volatility ‚Äì wider stops in volatile conditions, tighter in calm.

Position Sizing: Some risk management models use ATR to size positions ‚Äì taking smaller positions in high ATR situations so that the dollar volatility of the position stays consistent.

Identify Regime Changes: A sudden ATR rise can indicate a regime shift ‚Äì e.g., a breakout from a quiet range. Traders may pay attention when ATR expands above some threshold (like highest ATR in N days) as a cue that a new trend or phase might be starting.

Combine with Indicators: ATR can augment other signals. For instance, avoid breakout trades when ATR is extremely low (might indicate false break due to lack of interest), or conversely, be cautious shorting after a large move when ATR is at extremes (possible exhaustion).

Example: If a stock‚Äôs ATR(14) is 1.20, that means over the last 14 days, the average daily true range is $1.20. If today the stock moves only $0.50, that‚Äôs below ATR ‚Äì a relatively quiet day. If tomorrow it moves $3 (way above ATR), ATR will start rising, reflecting this increased volatility. A swing trader might set a stop $2 (roughly 1.7√ó ATR) away from entry to reduce chance of being stopped by normal noise.

Key point: ATR is relative to each stock. It‚Äôs useful to compare a stock‚Äôs ATR to itself over time (to see if volatility is up or down). To compare volatility between assets, often traders use ATR % of price (ATR divided by price) to normalize. For instance, a $100 stock with ATR $5 (5%) is more volatile than a $20 stock with ATR $0.5 (2.5%). Many charting tools plot ATR as a line below price; one can easily see volatility cycles.

(No direct ‚Äúoverbought/oversold‚Äù implications ‚Äì ATR is purely about range. A consistently climbing ATR could warn of heated volatility (riskier trading environment), whereas a very low ATR could precede a breakout as the saying goes ‚Äúrange contraction leads to range expansion.‚Äù)

Relative Volume (RVOL)

What it is: Relative Volume (often abbreviated RVOL) is a measure of current trading volume compared to its average/normal volume over a prior period
chartschool.stockcharts.com
. It‚Äôs typically expressed as a ratio or multiple. For example, RVOL = 3.0 means the stock is trading at 3 times its average volume for that time of day or period
chartschool.stockcharts.com
.

How it‚Äôs calculated: Commonly, RVOL = (current volume) / (average volume over X periods). The period could be intraday (e.g., comparing the volume traded so far today to the average volume by this time) or daily (today‚Äôs total volume vs. average daily volume). Many day traders look at intraday relative volume, which updates as the day progresses (comparing to typical volume profile at each time). Others use end-of-day RVOL = today‚Äôs volume / 50-day average daily volume, for instance.

Interpretation:

RVOL > 1: Higher-than-normal activity. If significantly >1 (like 2, 3, 5+), it indicates unusual interest in the stock today
chartschool.stockcharts.com
. This often correlates with a catalyst or technical event ‚Äì something is making traders trade it more than usual. High RVOL usually accompanies breakouts, big news, or significant price moves. It‚Äôs a confirmation of momentum: a breakout on 3√ó average volume is more reliable than on 0.5√ó volume.

RVOL < 1: Lower-than-normal volume. The stock is relatively quiet; possibly stuck in a range or lacking interest that day. Moves on low RVOL can be suspect (less participation).

There are specific thresholds: e.g., some traders consider RVOL > 2.0 as the threshold for a ‚Äúvolume spike‚Äù worth noting
chartschool.stockcharts.com
chartschool.stockcharts.com
. Extreme values like RVOL 5 or 10 indicate very high interest (could be early in the day after news).

Time factor: Volume in the morning is usually higher than mid-day for stocks. Good RVOL measures account for that. For instance, if by 10:30 AM a stock already traded its entire daily average volume, that‚Äôs extremely high relative volume early in the day ‚Äì noteworthy.

Uses:

Confirming Breakouts/Breakdowns: As mentioned, traders check that a breakout (price moving out of a range) is accompanied by RVOL above, say, 2. If a stock breaks key resistance but RVOL is only 0.5 (half average volume), the move may lack conviction and is more prone to fail.

Identifying In-Play Stocks: At market open, scanning for stocks with highest RVOL can reveal which tickers are ‚Äúin play‚Äù (likely due to news or events). These are often the best trading candidates for day traders ‚Äì high RVOL means volatility and opportunity.

Filtering Trade Signals: One might incorporate RVOL in a strategy: e.g., only take a trade signal if RVOL is above 1.5, ensuring the move isn‚Äôt happening in a dead market. Or avoid certain strategies (like mean reversion) if RVOL is extremely high (as that may indicate a strong trend day to not counter-trade).

Volume Climax/Reversal: Sometimes an extremely high RVOL, like a sudden spike to 4 or 5 times normal while price is also at an extreme, can mark a climax ‚Äì a lot of traders pile in, possibly exhausting the move. For instance, in a parabolic rally, volume often crescendos before a reversal. So very high RVOL can be a contrarian clue if other signs of exhaustion appear (blow-off top).

Example: A stock typically trades ~1 million shares a day. By lunchtime, it‚Äôs already at 3 million shares ‚Äì that‚Äôs an intraday RVOL of roughly 6 (by midday). This coincided with the company releasing unexpected good news at the open. The price is up 15% and breaking a 6-month range. The high RVOL confirms this is a significant event ‚Äì lots of traders are involved. A trader might jump in on a dip, confident that interest is high enough to carry it further, or they might simply keep it on watch as a top mover. On the other hand, another stock barely has 20% of its usual volume by lunch and is meandering ‚Äì likely no catalyst and not worth focus for now.

Note: Relative Volume is different from raw volume. A small-cap with normal volume 100k that is trading 500k today (RVOL 5) might still have less absolute volume than a mega-cap trading at 0.8 of normal but 5 million shares. RVOL highlights relative interest compared to that stock‚Äôs norm, which is more telling for unusual activity than absolute volume alone. It‚Äôs especially useful for finding opportunities in stocks you might otherwise ignore (low-volume stocks suddenly having a big day).

Position in Range (PIR)

What it is: Position in Range (PIR) indicates where the current price stands relative to a defined price range, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. Traders often use it for intraday position: where is the current price between today‚Äôs low and high. However, it can be applied to any period (week‚Äôs range, 52-week range, etc.)
trade-ideas.com
.

A PIR of 0% means the price is at the very bottom of the range (equal to the lowest price of that period)
trade-ideas.com
.

A PIR of 100% means price is at the very top of the range (equal to the highest price of that period).

50% would be exactly mid-range.

For intraday example: If today‚Äôs low is $20 and high is $30, and the stock is now at $25, then PIR = 50% (midway). If it‚Äôs at $29, PIR = 90% (near the top). If it‚Äôs $21, PIR ~10%. This is sometimes also called ‚Äú% of daily range‚Äù or just ‚ÄúPosition in Day‚Äôs Range.‚Äù

Why it‚Äôs useful:

It quickly tells you if the stock is trading near the highs of the day, near the lows, or somewhere in between. Many intraday strategies care about this: e.g., a stock closing the day at 90%+ of range is strong (close to highs), possibly indicating momentum into next day, whereas closing at 10% (near lows) shows weakness.

When combined with volume and other signals: a stock at 100% PIR late in the day on high volume likely had a strong trend day (buyers in control to the end). Conversely, a stock that was up earlier but now is at 10% of range (gave back gains) shows a reversal/intraday weakness.

For longer-term range, like 52-week PIR, it shows relative performance. A stock at 95% of its 52-week range is near its yearly high (strong over the year). At 5%, it‚Äôs near yearly lows (potentially beaten down or value buy area, depending on strategy).

Usage:

Intraday Trading: PIR is often displayed on scanners (e.g., ‚ÄúStocks making new highs of day‚Äù essentially is PIR hitting 100%). Traders might prefer to trade those hitting new highs (momentum) or new lows (for shorts) depending on strategy. Also, if one is in a long trade and sees PIR falling (price moving toward day‚Äôs low), that might be a sign to exit as the intraday trend is against them.

Range Strategies: As described in range-bound strategy, PIR is used to identify when price is near the extreme of a range. For instance, only consider a short if PIR > 90% (price is in top 10% of its recent range = near resistance), or a buy if PIR < 10% (near support).

EOD (End of Day) Analysis: Investors check where price closed relative to the day‚Äôs range. A close at high (PIR ~100%) is bullish, possibly leading to a gap or follow-through next day. A close at low (PIR ~0%) is bearish, maybe more downside tomorrow. Do note it‚Äôs one factor; news overnight can trump this.

Multi-day Ranges: Some indicators use PIR concept over several days. For example, 5-day PIR could tell if today‚Äôs price is near the weekly high or low. This can be helpful in context (e.g. a breakout stock might also be at 100% of its weekly range, showing multi-day strength). Some scanners filter stocks above 90% of their 20-day range as potential breakout candidates.

Example: Suppose a stock traded between $50 and $55 this week. It‚Äôs currently at $54. That‚Äôs near the top, roughly PIR = 80% for the week. If intraday it had a low of $53 and a high of $54.5 so far, at $54 it‚Äôs ~ (54-53)/(54.5-53) ‚âà 66% intraday PIR. So intraday it‚Äôs upper-middle, and relative to the week it‚Äôs upper end. A trader seeing this near the close might say ‚ÄúThis stock is closing strong, near its highs (PIR high on multiple frames) ‚Äì momentum is up.‚Äù Another stock might be flat on day but still near 52-week highs (say PIR 90% on yearly range) ‚Äì that indicates overall strength even if today didn‚Äôt move much.

Caveats:

In very volatile stocks, PIR can swing quickly. One should consider time ‚Äì e.g., a stock might drop to new low (0% PIR) in morning, then rally to high (100%) by afternoon. Just looking at final PIR (100%) you‚Äôd think it was strong all day, but intraday there was huge weakness first. Thus context of intraday progression matters; PIR is a snapshot of position, not the path taken.

For multi-period PIR (like 5-day or 1-month), a stock could stay at high PIR because it‚Äôs in a steady uptrend (keeps making new highs so always at top of range). That‚Äôs fine ‚Äì it indicates strength, but also means the range is shifting upward. Traders sometimes reset the range definition periodically to reflect new regimes.

In summary, PIR is a simple yet effective gauge of where price is trading relative to extremes. It‚Äôs especially popular in scanning for momentum or reversal setups and in summarizing performance in a period (e.g., ‚ÄúStock ABC closed in the top 5% of its daily range, very bullish sign‚Äù).

Gap % (Gap Percentage)

What it is: Gap % measures the percentage difference between a stock‚Äôs opening price and its previous closing price. In formula: Gap % = ((Today‚Äôs Open ‚Äì Yesterday‚Äôs Close) / Yesterday‚Äôs Close) √ó 100%. It indicates how much the stock ‚Äúgapped‚Äù up or down at the start of the trading day, as a proportion of its prior closing price.

A gap up occurs when today‚Äôs open is higher than yesterday‚Äôs close (Gap % will be positive)
kotaksecurities.com
.

A gap down is when today‚Äôs open is lower than yesterday‚Äôs close (Gap % negative).

For example, if a stock closed at $100 and today opens at $105, that‚Äôs a +5% gap up. If it opened at $95, that‚Äôs a -5% gap down. Partial gaps (opening within the prior day‚Äôs range) are usually smaller, whereas full gaps (opening beyond the prior day‚Äôs range entirely) can be larger and more significant
investopedia.com
.

Significance:

Catalyst Indicator: Large gaps are almost always due to some news or event (earnings, analyst upgrade/downgrade, economic data, etc.) that occurred outside regular hours. Thus, gap percentage quickly tells the scale of reaction to such catalysts. A stock gapping +10% likely has notable positive news; -15% likely bad news.

Market Sentiment: Gap ups show bullish sentiment at the open; gap downs show bearish sentiment. The size of the gap reflects how extreme that initial sentiment is. However, what happens after the open (does the gap hold or get filled?) is crucial ‚Äì sometimes an initial gap direction can reverse intraday.

Gap Fill Tendency: Many traders watch if gaps get ‚Äúfilled‚Äù. A gap fill means price moves back to the prior close level. A strong stock might gap up and not fill the gap (stays above previous close, indicating sustained strength). A weak gap may fill quickly (e.g., gap up then sells off back to yesterday‚Äôs close ‚Äì bullish enthusiasm was fleeting). There are strategies specifically trading gap fills. Gap % helps identify candidates (e.g., stock gapped up 2% but weak volume ‚Äì maybe short for gap fill).

Usage:

Scanning: In pre-market or right after open, traders scan for biggest gap % up or down to find active stocks. E.g., ‚ÄúTop Gappers‚Äù list the stocks with highest positive gap %; ‚ÄúTop Gap-downs‚Äù similarly. Those often become focus of day trades.

Strategy Filters: Some strategies only trigger if a gap is beyond a certain size. For instance, a ‚ÄúGap-and-Go‚Äù strategy might say: if gap up > +4% and stock has news and breaks above opening range high, then go long for momentum continuation. Conversely, mean reversion players might short excessively large gap ups expecting some pullback (especially if gap is on hype without substance).

Calculating Targets/Stops: Gap % can be used to gauge potential intraday range. A stock that gaps 10% may run further but also can retrace ‚Äì traders might set wider stops or profit targets considering that initial 10% jump as part of the day‚Äôs move. If a gap is very large (like >15-20%), sometimes traders wait for a pullback or consolidation, as jumping in at open can be riskier.

Contextual Analysis: Not all gaps are equal. A 3% gap on a stock that normally hardly moves could be huge. On a volatile small-cap biotech, 3% might be noise. So one often checks Gap % relative to typical volatility (here ATR or historical gap frequency helps). Also, a gap that breaks key technical levels (like opening above a long-term resistance) is extra meaningful.

Example: Yesterday Apple closed at $150. Overnight, they announced blowout earnings. The next morning it opens at $159. That‚Äôs a +6% gap. It‚Äôs also opening at a new all-time high, above any prior resistance. Traders see this gap % and high volume pre-market as a strong bullish signal. Some will buy at open or on the first pullback, expecting further upside (gap-and-go). Another scenario: A smaller company closed at $10; bad FDA news hits, it opens at $7 (a -30% gap down). That‚Äôs massive ‚Äì likely panic selling. A contrarian might watch if it stabilizes; perhaps it fills part of that gap intraday if the reaction was overdone. But they‚Äôd be cautious ‚Äì big gap downs often continue bleeding.

Gaps on Indexes: Gap % is also used for indices and futures. E.g., ‚ÄúS&P500 futures are gapping down 1.5% this morning on XYZ fears.‚Äù That sets a tone for the market day. Traders adjust because a gap in indices can invalidate or create setups for many stocks (market sentiment shift).

In summary, Gap % quickly quantifies the overnight sentiment shift and gives traders an initial map of who‚Äôs strongly in play. The assistant can use gap % to explain morning moves or to decide if a stock‚Äôs early strength/weakness might continue or reverse, often in conjunction with volume and news context.

SMA50 (50-day Simple Moving Average)

What it is: SMA50 is the 50-day Simple Moving Average of a stock‚Äôs price. ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù means it‚Äôs the arithmetic mean ‚Äì add the closing prices of the last 50 trading days and divide by 50. It‚Äôs called a moving average because as each day passes, it‚Äôs recalculated with the latest 50-day window (dropping the oldest day, adding the newest). The SMA50 is one of the most commonly watched mid-term trend indicators in technical analysis
investopedia.com
. Others include SMA20 (short-term) and SMA200 (long-term).

Interpretation:

The SMA50 smooths out short-term fluctuations to show the intermediate trend of the stock. If price is consistently above the SMA50 and the SMA50 line is sloping upward, the stock is generally in an intermediate uptrend. If price is below and SMA50 sloping down, in a downtrend.

This average often acts as a dynamic support or resistance. In many uptrends, pullbacks find support around the rising 50-day MA
investopedia.com
(buyers step in there). Likewise, in downtrends, SMA50 can be a ceiling (price rises to it, then falls again). Traders and algorithms watch these levels, which can become self-fulfilling to a degree.

Crossovers: Sometimes the SMA50 is used with SMA200. For example, the ‚ÄúGolden Cross‚Äù is when SMA50 crosses above SMA200, indicating a bullish shift; ‚ÄúDeath Cross‚Äù is SMA50 crossing below SMA200, a bearish sign. Those are longer-term signals.

Context matters: In a strongly trending stock, the SMA50 might be far below price (the stock is extended above it). Eventually, either price might mean-revert to the SMA or move sideways until the SMA catches up. Conversely, if a stock has been below SMA50 for a long time and finally closes above it, that‚Äôs notable ‚Äì could indicate trend change upward.

Uses:

Trend Following: A basic rule might be: only take long trades if price is above SMA50 (trend is up), only short if below. Or an investor might increase exposure when price is above SMA50 and cut back if it falls below (as a stop-out rule).

Support/Resistance Trades: Many swing traders watch for bounces near the SMA50 in uptrends to buy (as part of a pullback strategy). Similarly, if a stock is rallying in a longer downtrend, they might sell/short when it nears SMA50, expecting it to hold as resistance. Confirmation with candlesticks or other indicators is often used (like a bullish reversal candle right at SMA50 support is a buy signal).

Target or Stop Guide: If one is long and stock is way above SMA50, one might use a break of the SMA50 as a trailing stop exit (since that suggests momentum fading). For targets, sometimes if price breaks out, you might project move based on distance from MAs or use them as interim checkpoints.

Combining with PIR or RSI: For example, a stock might be near 52-week highs (PIR high) but far above its SMA50 (say 20% above). That may imply overextension ‚Äì price might revert to SMA50 or at least cool off. RSI might also be overbought in such case. So SMA50 can signal when something is stretched relative to an intermediate baseline.

Market Breadth: On a broader scale, analysts look at what percentage of stocks in an index are above their SMA50 ‚Äì to gauge market health. E.g., ‚Äúonly 20% of S&P500 stocks are above their 50-day MA, showing weakness across the board‚Äù or vice versa for strength.

Example: Stock XYZ in a steady uptrend: Over last 3 months, it‚Äôs been making higher highs, and each dip has bounced around the SMA50. The SMA50 line is rising from $100 to $120 over that period. The stock is now at $135, about 12% above its SMA50 at $120. If it pulls back, a trader might anticipate support near $120-$125 zone (which may coincide with prior highs or Fibonacci levels, strengthening that area). If planning a new entry, one might even wait for a drift towards SMA50 to get a better price. On the flip side, if XYZ starts trading below $120 and the SMA50 flattens or turns down, that uptrend might be over ‚Äì time to possibly exit or not initiate new longs.

Remember: The SMA50 is a lagging indicator (it averages past data). It won‚Äôt predict sudden changes, but it gives a reliable trend reference. It works best in trending conditions and as support/resistance in orderly markets. In very volatile or sideways markets, price may whipsaw above/below SMA50 frequently, giving false signals. In those cases, longer MAs or other tools might be needed. Traders also sometimes use EMA (Exponential MA) which weights recent prices more, for quicker response ‚Äì but SMA50 remains a widely cited metric in media and by institutional traders, making it a self-reinforcing indicator at times.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

What it is: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in a stock
investopedia.com
. RSI values range from 0 to 100. It‚Äôs typically calculated over a 14-period timeframe (14 days on a daily chart by default). RSI compares the average of up closes to the average of down closes in that period.

Key Levels: By convention:

RSI > 70: The asset is considered overbought
investopedia.com
. This doesn‚Äôt mean it will crash immediately, but it signals the price has risen quickly/strongly and may be due for a pullback or pause. Traders watch for RSI crossing below 70 as a potential sell signal if they are long, or as a flag to not initiate new longs. Extremely high RSI (80s or 90s) shows very strong momentum but also extreme conditions.

RSI < 30: The asset is considered oversold
investopedia.com
. It may have fallen too fast, and could be due for a bounce or reversal upward. Traders might look for RSI crossing back above 30 as a buy signal, indicating a recovery from heavy selling. Extremely low RSI (<20) is rare and denotes extreme bearish momentum (could also be opportunity if a reversal pattern forms).

Midline 50: An RSI around 50 indicates a balance, often coinciding with a consolidating price. Many chartists note that in uptrends, RSI tends to oscillate between 40 and 80 (with pullbacks bottoming ~40-50 RSI, never reaching oversold 30), whereas in downtrends RSI oscillates between 20 and 60 (rallies fizzle around 50-60, not reaching overbought 70).

Uses:

Momentum Confirmation: A rising RSI confirms upward momentum; falling RSI confirms downward. If price makes a new high and RSI also makes a new high (but still maybe <70), momentum is healthy.

Divergences: A classic use of RSI is spotting divergences. For example, bearish divergence: price makes a higher high but RSI makes a lower high (especially if RSI was overbought on first high). This can warn that the momentum behind the new high is weaker, often preceding a downturn. Bullish divergence: price makes a lower low but RSI a higher low (especially RSI oversold on first low). This suggests selling pressure is waning, often before a bounce. Divergences are more reliable when RSI is extreme on the first swing.

Entry/Exit Signals: Some simple systems buy when RSI crosses above 30 from below (signal that oversold condition is ending, momentum turning up) and sell when RSI crosses below 70 from above
investopedia.com
. More aggressive traders might buy exactly when RSI is very low (anticipating a mean reversion bounce) or short when RSI very high, but those can be risky without other confirmation since ‚Äúoverbought can stay overbought‚Äù in strong trends.

Trend identification: As mentioned, the RSI range can indicate trend. If RSI has trouble getting above 60, likely the market is in a bearish mode. If it rarely dips below 40, it‚Äôs bullish mode. This helps adjust expectations ‚Äì e.g., in a strong uptrend, an RSI reaching 70 isn‚Äôt necessarily a sell, it might just oscillate between 50-80 repeatedly as the trend continues.

Example: A stock has been rallying for weeks; RSI is now about 78. That‚Äôs a flag it‚Äôs overbought. A trader holding it may tighten stops or take partial profits. Soon after, price stalls and RSI dips back to 69 ‚Äì crossing below 70. This could be an early sign of a pullback. If simultaneously perhaps a divergence was seen (price made a higher high last push, RSI made a slightly lower high), that strengthens the case for a pullback. The trader might exit or even short for a quick mean reversion, expecting RSI to fall towards neutral (50) or even oversold if a deeper correction.

Another scenario: A stock has sold off from $50 to $30; RSI is ~25 (oversold). Support is seen at $30 from last year‚Äôs base. The next day, it makes a slight new low to $29 while RSI now reads 32 (it rose despite the new low ‚Äì bullish divergence). That, coupled with support, encourages a swing trader to go long, seeing that sellers are possibly exhausted. Over the next week, the stock bounces to $35 and RSI goes to 55, vindicating the entry. They might then watch if RSI approaches 70 (if aiming to hold until momentum wanes).

Cautions:

RSI can remain extended in strong trends. If a stock has continuous positive news, it might ride with RSI 75-85 for a while. Shorting just because RSI > 70 without other signals can be painful. It‚Äôs often better used to exit longs rather than outright short, unless other factors align.

Very short period RSI (like 5-day) will oscillate more wildly and give more frequent signals, but could be less reliable. 14 is standard, but traders adjust depending on timeframe (on a 1-hour chart, might use 14 hours; on weekly chart, 14 weeks, etc.).

Ensure not to confuse relative strength (which compares performance to another asset or index) with RSI. RSI is a specific bounded momentum oscillator.

In summary, RSI is a handy gauge of momentum‚Äôs intensity and potential reversal points. The assistant can use RSI to comment on whether an asset looks overextended (‚ÄúRSI is above 70, indicating overbought conditions that could precede a pullback
investopedia.com
‚Äù) or lacks momentum (‚ÄúRSI has been stuck around 45-50, reflecting a lack of trend‚Äù). It‚Äôs a staple indicator in technical analysis for good reason, but best used in conjunction with price action and trend context.
